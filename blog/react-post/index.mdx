I'm going to be honest, I never thought that writing ReactJS code was something that I was ever going to do. I used hate the idea of using frameworks instead of using the golden trio of HTML, CSS and JS. I was one of those separation of concerns type people (I will admit that I still am) but, writing ReactJS felt natural to me. It is a pretty fun language to get a grasp of and I think that React, and Svelte (even though this is about React) both have changed my mind on writing with frameworks. They make a lot of things so much easier and I can't believe it has taken me this long to hop on the frameworks train.
