## JavaScript: The Brains

Ah, JavaScript. What a lovely little scripting language. From its quick inception (a 6 month feat) back in 1995 at the hands of its creator, Brendan Eich, to the maturity it has reached nowadays that enables us to build modern applications, JavaScript has been the brains of pretty much every single web page and web app since.
That said, I’m going to be zeroing in on a few of my favorite JavaScript features.

## Event Handling

Event handling probably is, for me, hands down the best part of JavaScript. The amount of interaction you can achieve using events is astounding. By far, the most common one is click, since click can both be used as standard mouse click and also responds to touch, although events that specifically handle touch do exist.
If you want to see an event in action, try using the Google Search bar. It uses one of the keypress events in order to detect what you’re typing. From there, it hooks into either using fetch or AJAX and dynamically updates the autocomplete based on what you’re typing. This is such a great user interaction, in my opinion. In the next section, I linked something that does something similar, albeit, not as cool as Google Search.

## Communicating with APIs using Fetch

One of my other favorites things about JavaScript is the ability to communicate with APIs using fetch or even AJAX. The sky is the limit when using fetch. You can create so many applications. On Github, there is a repository with free public APIs that can be used for just about any project need. Using this API resource, I made this simple dictionary based project. The API that I used was the DictionaryAPI (https://my-dictionary-card-site.surge.sh/).
This simple project includes two of my favorite JavaScript features: event handling and fetch. I love the idea of using events and APIs to create an interactive experience with very minimal code. You can create just about anything without having to worry about things like databases or servers. Just good ol’ HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
